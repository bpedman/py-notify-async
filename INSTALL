			 SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

Py-notify requires Python 2.3 or later.  It currently contains no C
code, but that is expected to appear.  So, while a C compiler is not
required at the moment, it will be required for later versions.



		 PY-NOTIFY INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Normally, just executing

	./setup.py install

under a super-user account from this directory should suffice.
However, it will create root-owned files in source tree, so you should
use

	./setup.py build
	su
	[PASSWORD]
	./setup.py install

instead.

In general, Py-notify installation doesn't involve anything uncommon.
It should be just like that of any Python package that uses distutils.
