			 SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

Py-notify requires Python 2.3 or later and a C compiler supported by
distutils (there is one module written in C for performance reasons).

Starting with 0.1.13, Py-notify should also work with SVN Python 3000.
However, since Py3k itself is still an alpha stages, build can quickly
become broken as Py3k changes.



		 PY-NOTIFY INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Normally, just executing

	./setup.py install

under a super-user account from this directory should suffice.
However, it will create root-owned files in source tree, so you should
use

	./setup.py build
	su
	[PASSWORD]
	./setup.py install

instead.

In general, Py-notify installation doesn't involve anything uncommon.
It should be just like that of any Python package that uses distutils.



		     INSTALLING WITH EASYINSTALL

Py-notify can be installed directly from its website if you have
EasyInstall (a.k.a. Python egg management tool).  Just type:

	easy_install py-notify

(normally under super user account).

Note that I don't upload eggs to PyPI page[1], as Py-notify is meant
for developers and developers should be able to compile a simple
package from sources anyway.
