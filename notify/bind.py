"""
Bindings are callables with advanced comparing capabilities.  This can be useful when
equality/inequality test is required as is the case with L{signals <signal>}.  For
instance, the main difference from lambdas can be shown with this example:

    >>> a = lambda x: x + 3
    ... b = lambda x: x + 3
    ... a != b
    ...
    ... import operator
    ... from notify.bind import *
    ...
    ... p = Binding (operator.add, 3)
    ... q = Binding (operator.add, 3)
    ... p == q
    ...
    ... a (10) == p (10)  # Check that it indeed does what it should.

So, lambdas are great and provide more functionality than bindings, but they won’t work if
you need comparing callables for equality.

Another thing not possible with lambdas (or bound methods, for that matter) is to bind
object I{weakly}.  In other words, as long as there is a bound method or lambda in
existence, object is considered referenced and won’t be garbage-collected.  This can be
good, but not always what you want.

Class L{WeakBinding} and its descendants bind object weakly.  In other words, as long as
object is not garbage-collected, e.g. referenced from somewhere, they work just like
normal L{Binding}.  However, they don’t create a strong reference to the object and, if it
is destroyed, things get different: L{WeakBinding} does nothing when called, while
L{RaisingWeakBinding} raises L{GarbageCollectedError} exception.

Finally, it is possible to create bindings with a list of precreated arguments.  Any
arguments passed to binding’s L{__call__ <Binding.__call__>} method will be I{appended} to
this list and passed to wrapped callable together.  Of course, this and more is possible
with lambdas and is not an advantage of bindings, just a feature.
