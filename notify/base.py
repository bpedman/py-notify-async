        Generate an iterable of pairs in the form (Python identifier, value) for a new
        type created by C{L{derive_type}}.  Exact pairs should be influenced by
        C{options}, which are C{options} as passed to C{derive_type} plus C{self_class}
        (for convenience) and C{new_class_name}.

        This method is not meant to be callable from outside, use C{L{derive_type}} for
        that instead.

        Overriden implementations of this method are recommended but not required to be
        generator functions.  They should generally start like this:

            >>> def _generate_derived_type_dictionary (self_class, options):
            ...     for attribute in super (..., self_class)._generate_derived_type_dictionary (options):
            ...         yield attribute
            ...
            ...     ...

        That is only an approximation and you can, for instance, change or override
        attributes returned by super-method.

        C{options} dictionary is constructed in such a way you should be able to evaluate
        all function-defining statements in it.  For instance, you can write own
        C{_generate_derived_type_dictionary} like this:

            >>> def _generate_derived_type_dictionary (self_class, options):
            ...     ...
            ...
            ...     functions = {}

            ...         yield function

        Returned value for C{__slots__} is treated specially.  While normally values
        associated with the same name override previous values, values for C{__slots__}
        are combined in to a tuple instead.

        @rtype:           iterable
