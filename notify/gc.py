"""
A module for protecting objects from garbage collector.  Sometimes, objects that don’t
have a reference to them (and so are valid garbage collector targets) need to stay alive.
Good example of this are logic L{conditions <condition>}: their state can change because
they have term conditions, yet they may be not referenced from anywhere, since handlers
don’t need a reference to notice a state change.

This module defines both a simple L{interface <AbstractGCProtector>} and several
implementations, some, which are suitable for production use (C{L{FastGCProtector}}), some
for debugging purposes (C{L{RaisingGCProtector}}, C{L{DebugGCProtector}}.)

Py-notify classes use value of the C{AbstractGCProtector.default} variable as the
protector instance.  In case you run into a problem, set it to an instance of
C{DebugGCProtector} or a similar class to track the problem down (somewhere near your
program beginning).  However, we believe that Py-notify classes must not cause problems
themselves, they may pop up only if you use a garbage-collection protector yourself.
