"""
L{Signals <AbstractSignal>} are lists of callables (I{handlers}) that are called in turn
when the signal is I{emitted}.  They allow for separation between initiators and listeners
of some event.

Here is an unrealistic example of usage:

    >>> from notify.signal import *
    ... import sys
    ...
    ... night = Signal ()
    ... night.connect (lambda: sys.stdout.write ("It's late already\\n"))
    ...
    ... class Person (object):
    ...     def __init__(self, name, is_active = False):
    ...         self.__name      = name
    ...         self.__is_active = is_active
    ...         night.connect (self.__on_night)
    ...     def go_on_a_trip (self):
    ...         sys.stdout.write ('%s goes on a trip\\n' % self.__name)
    ...         night.disconnect (self.__on_night)
    ...     def __on_night (self):
    ...         if self.__is_active:
    ...             sys.stdout.write ('%s goes to a dancing\\n' % self.__name)
    ...         else:
    ...             sys.stdout.write ('%s yawns and goes to sleep\\n' % self.__name)
    ...
    ... bob   = Person ('Bob')
    ... irene = Person ('Irene')
    ... pete  = Person ('Pete', True)
    ...
    ... night.emit ()
    ... irene.go_on_a_trip ()
    ... night.emit ()

It gives the following output::

    It's late already
    Bob yawns and goes to sleep
    Irene yawns and goes to sleep
    Pete goes to a dancing
    Irene goes on a trip
    It's late already
    Bob yawns and goes to sleep
    Pete goes to a dancing

Note that the program itself only decides “when a night starts”, it doesn’t know what
happens to whom then.  Class C{Person} connects or disconnects its handler to C{night}
signal itself.

Brief Comparison With GObject Signals
=====================================

    U{PyGObject <http://pygtk.org/>} provides its own kind of signals.  They may or may
    not be more efficient for your particular case and which implementation to use is of
    course your choice.  Here is a brief list of major differences.

      - Py-notify signals are objects.  Therefore, they are not bound to class contexts
        and can be passed around, created locally and so on.

      - There is no default handler for a class in Py-notify.  Since signals are not bound
        to classes, this is even impossible.

      - Py-notify signal handlers are not type-safe.  This is a result of native Pythonic
        implementation.  (PyGObject wraps C signals from U{GLib <http://gtk.org/>}.)

      - There are no connection IDs, handlers can be disconnected only by passing the same
        handler to C{L{disconnect <AbstractSignal.disconnect>}} method.  This is less
        efficient, but easier to use.

      - Py-notify signals are U{slower <http://home.gna.org/py-notify/benchmark.html>}.
        This may be important in time-critical code if you use signals heavily.

    In general, you should use whatever suits your needs better.  GObject signals are
    limited to C{gobject.GObject} class derivatives.
