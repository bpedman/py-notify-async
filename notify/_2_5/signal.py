@contextmanager
def connecting (self, handler, *arguments, **keywords):
    """
    connecting(self, handler, *arguments)

    Create a context manager temporarily connecting C{handler} with C{arguments} to the
    signal.  Upon exit, returned context manager disconnects the handler.

    It is legal to modify handler list of the signal inside a C{with} block.  In
    particular, you can disconnect the handler yourself, before the context manager does
    so.  Remember, however, that the context manager will still try to disconnect, so this
    will give two disconnection of the handler.  If it is connected more than once, both
    disconnections will succeed.

    Example usage:
       >>> def note (argument):
       ...     print argument
       ...
       ... with signal.connecting (note):
       ...     signal ('this is going to be noted')
       ...
       ... signal ('and this is not')

    @note:
    This method is available only in Python 2.5 or newer.

    @note:
    To enable C{with} statement in Python 2.5 you need to add this line at the top of your
    module:
        >>> from __future__ import with_statement

    @see:  C{L{disconnect}}

    connecting_safely(self, handler, *arguments)

    Create a context manager temporarily connecting C{handler} with C{arguments} to the
    signal, but only if it is not connected already.  Only if the handler is connected,
    returned context manager will disconnect it again upon exit.  See C{L{connecting}} for
    details.

@contextmanager
def blocking (self, handler, *arguments, **keywords):
    """
    blocking(self, handler, *arguments, **keywords)

    Create a context manager temporarily blocking C{handler} with C{arguments}.  Upon
    exit, returned context manager unblocks the handler.

    If the handler is not connected when context is entered, the manager does nothing
    during both entering and exiting.  In other words, if you enter a context, and only
    then connect and manually block the handler, it will I{not} be unblocked by the
    manager.

    Example usage:
       >>> def note (argument):
       ...     print argument
       ...
       ... signal.connect (note)
       ... signal ('this is going to be noted')
