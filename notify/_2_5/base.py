#       Don't forget to remove various weirdness here meant to make Epydoc work smoothly

def storing (self, handler, *arguments):
    """
    storing(self, handler, *arguments)

    Create a context manager that will temporarily store object value using C{handler}
    with C{arguments}.  Upon exit, returned context manager disconnects the handler from
    ‘changed’ signal, cancelling effect of C{L{store}}.

    It is legal to modify handler list of ‘changed’ signal inside a C{with} block.  In
    particular, you can disconnect the handler yourself, before the context manager does
    so.  Remember, however, that the context manager will still try to disconnect, so this
    will give two disconnection of the handler.  If it is connected more than once, both
    disconnections will succeed.

    Example usage:
       >>> variable = Variable (1)
       ...
       ... def note (argument):
       ...     print argument
       ...
       ... variable.value = 2
       ... with variable.storing (note):
       ...     variable.value = 3
       ...
       ... variable.value = 4

    This code prints number 2 and 3, but not 1 or 4.  Number 2 is printed because
    C{store()} passes it as initializing value to C{note()} handler; 3 because C{note()}
    is connected to ‘changed’ signal at that time.  But by the time 4 is assigned to
    variable value, C{note()} is already disconnected.

    This method is available only in Python 2.5 or newer.

@contextmanager
def changes_frozen (self):
    """
    changes_frozen(self)

    Create a context manager that will temporarily disable all emissions of ‘changed’
    signal for this object.  However, if object value changes while the context manager is
    in effect, it will emit ‘changed’ signal once, upon exiting.

    Returned context managers can be nested.  In this case, any nested freezing manager
    will I{not} emit ‘changed’ signal, leaving it for the outmost one.

    This method is useful in the following cases:

      - you expect many changes in object’s value, but want interested parties be informed
        about final result only, not about all intermediate states;

      - you expect at least two changes and the final result may be “no changes” compared
        to original;

      - you expect many changes, don’t care about intermediate states and want to improve
        performance.

    In the second case, if the result is indeed “no changes”, context manager ensures that
    ‘changed’ signal is not emitted at all.

    Example usage:
       >>> variable = Variable ()
       ... variable.changed.connect (lambda value: sys.stdout.write ('%s\\n' % value))
       ...
       ... with variable.changes_frozen ():
       ...     a_method_that_can_modify_value (variable)
