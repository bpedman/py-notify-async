"""
A collection of utilities that can also be used from outside, if wanted.  Functions and
classes here can be assumed public and won’t disappear in future Py-notify versions.

@var is_callable:
Determine if C{object} is callable.  E.g. if it is a function, method, class, instance of
a class with C{__call__}, etc.  This is the same as built-in function C{callable} does.
C{is_callable} is provided since C{callable} is going to disappear in Python 3000 and may
issue warnings in 2.6.

@var as_string:
Convert any attribute to its name as string.  Main use of this utility object is to
perform Python ‘private’ identifier mangling.  E.g. you can write::

    class MyClass (object):
        __slots__ = ('__x')
        def get_x (self):
            if hasattr (self, as_string.__x):
                return self.__x

Advantage is that you don’t have to do mangling ‘by hands’ and hence there is less chance
for a typing error.  Furthermore, this code does not require changes if you change
C{MyClass} name to anything else, whereas custom mangling does.

However, usefulness of ‘as_string’ is still doubtful.  When I wrote it, I didn’t know one
could just write ``__slots__ = ('__x')``, I thought it needed to be
``__slots__ = ('_MyClass__x')``.  Imagine...
