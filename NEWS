--- New in Py-notify 0.1.11 ------------------------------------------

* Major speed optimization in signal emission.  Now all benchmarks run
  about 30% faster.

* Many small improvements and fixes in derive_type() machinery.

* Minor internal code improvements.

* 18 more unit tests (147/169 in total.)


--- New in Py-notify 0.1.10 ------------------------------------------

* Possibility to freeze changes in conditions and variabes.

* For Python 2.5+ only: 8 context manager methods for signals,
  conditions and variables.

* Expanded tutorial.

* Other small improvements and fixes.

* 31 more unit tests (151 in total.)  Now not all tests run under
  Python 2.3 or 2.4; for them there are only 129 tests.


--- New in Py-notify 0.1.9 -------------------------------------------

* Fixed and improved `setup.py' script.

* New RaisingGCProtector class.

* 6 new unit tests (120 in total.)


--- New in Py-notify 0.1.8 -------------------------------------------

* Improved and fixed derive_type() class method in several
  AbstractValueObject-derived classes.

* Mediators and bindings got __hash__() method.

* Informative string representation added to bindings and
  DummyReference class, improved in signals.

* Other small improvements and fixes.

* 8 new unit tests (114 in total) and several improved.


--- New in Py-notify 0.1.7 -------------------------------------------

* Improved documentation.  Some documentation files that didn't
  previously make it to source distribution now do.

* Many minor improvements and fixes.

* New `examples' subdirectory with one but non-trivial example.

* 1 removed and 9 new unit tests (106 in total.)

* 1 new benchmark test (5 in total.)


--- New in Py-notify 0.1.6 -------------------------------------------

* Adopted "Don't repeat yourself" principle, therefore most functions
  that duplicate properties are renamed and made private.  This breaks
  backward compatibility, but better now than never, since user base
  is nonexistent.

* Some bug-fixes and proper Pythonic __eq__, __ne__ and numeric
  methods.

* New DebugGCProtector class.

* Improved or added documentation for many methods.

* Infrastructure script improvements and fixes.

* 6 more unit tests (98 in total.)


--- New in Py-notify 0.1.5 -------------------------------------------

* Added a tutorial.

* Improved or added documentation for many methods.

* New functions to cancel effects of synchronize() for condiions and
  variables.

* Several more properties in different classes.  In general, use
  properties instead of methods more.

* Some bug-fixes.

* 5 more unit tests (92 in total.)


--- New in Py-notify 0.1.4 -------------------------------------------

* New fast and generic GC-protector module (notify.gc) replaces
  inefficient mark_object_as_used() and mark_object_as_unused()
  functions.

* Speed optimizations in bindings.

* 2 more unit tests (87 in total.)

* 2 more benchmark tests (4 in total.)


--- New in Py-notify 0.1.3 -------------------------------------------

* New class `WatcherVariable', just like `WatcherCondition'.

* Many bug-fixes in `Signal' class and in standard signal value
  accumulators.

* Speed optimizations in bindings and signals.

* 18 more unit tests (85 in total.)



--- New in Py-notify 0.1.2 -------------------------------------------

* Bug-fixes in `WatcherCondition' and `AbstractSignal' classes.

* Plugged memory leak in `AbstractValueObject' signal creation.

* 8 more unit tests (67 in total.)

* Benchmarking support (with single comparison to PyGObject at
  present.)



--- New in Py-notify 0.1.1 -------------------------------------------

* First released version.

* Support for signals, conditions, variables, logical composition of
  conditions, predicate conditions and other features.

* 59 unit tests.
