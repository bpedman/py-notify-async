--- New in Py-notify 0.1.6 -------------------------------------------

* Adopted "Don't repeat yourself" principle, therefore most functions
  that duplicate properties are renamed and made private.  This breaks
  backward compatibility, but better now than never, since user base
  is nonexistent.

* Some bug-fixes and proper Pythonic __eq__, __ne__ and numeric
  methods.

* New DebugGCProtector class.

* Improved or added documentation for many methods.

* Infrastructure script improvements and fixes.

* 6 more unit test (98 in total.)


--- New in Py-notify 0.1.5 -------------------------------------------

* Added a tutorial.

* Improved or added documentation for many methods.

* New functions to cancel effects of synchronize() for condiions and
  variables.

* Several more properties in different classes.  In general, use
  properties instead of methods more.

* Some bug-fixes.

* 5 more unit tests (92 in total.)


--- New in Py-notify 0.1.4 -------------------------------------------

* New fast and generic GC-protector module (notify.gc) replaces
  inefficient mark_object_as_used() and mark_object_as_unused()
  functions.

* Speed optimizations in bindings.

* 2 more unit tests (87 in total.)

* 2 more benchmark tests (4 in total.)


--- New in Py-notify 0.1.3 -------------------------------------------

* New class `WatcherVariable', just like `WatcherCondition'.

* Many bug-fixes in `Signal' class and in standard signal value
  accumulators.

* Speed optimizations in bindings and signals.

* 18 more unit tests (85 in total.)



--- New in Py-notify 0.1.2 -------------------------------------------

* Bug-fixes in `WatcherCondition' and `AbstractSignal' classes.

* Plugged memory leak in `AbstractValueObject' signal creation.

* 8 more unit tests (67 in total.)

* Benchmarking support (with single comparison to PyGObject at
  present.)
