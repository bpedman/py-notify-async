--- New in Py-notify 0.2.1  (21 September 2008) ----------------------

* Updated to compile and work with Python 3.0rc1.

* A few minor fixes for potential bugs and optimizations in
  `notify.gc' module and in documentation.


### New in Py-notify 0.2.0  (6 May 2008) #############################

* First stable version.  158/180 unit tests.  All pass with Python
  2.3, 2.5, SVN trunk (heading to 2.6) and SVN py3k branch on Debian
  GNU/Linux.

* One more improvement in test framework.  Tiny improvement in
  `run-tests.py' for Py3k.

######################################################################


--- New in Py-notify 0.1.15  (3 March 2008) --------------------------

* Important bug-fix in `CleanSignal'.

* `AbstractGCProtector.default' cannot be changed anymore if the
  current default protector is used.  In practice, it can be changed
  only on program startup.

* Changed internals of `AbstractGCProtector.default' (in backward
  compatible fashion) to avoid screwing class attribute cache in
  upcoming Python 2.6 (see http://bugs.python.org/issue1878).

* Documentation improvements.

* 1 more unit test (158/180 in total).  Much improved test framework
  catches more bugs for already written tests.


--- New in Py-notify 0.1.14  (28 December 2007) ----------------------

* Update to work with SVN Py3k again.

* Fix build on MinGW at least in some cases (#10560).

* A few documentation and infrastructure fixes and changes.


--- New in Py-notify 0.1.13  (17 November 2007) ----------------------

* Changed to work under SVN builds of Python 3000 too.  It still
  requires only 2.3 or later.  Note that one testcase fails under
  Py3k, but that is a Py3k bug: http://bugs.python.org/issue1393.
  [P.S. Py3k was fixed later.]

* A few minor bugfixes.

* 2 new unit tests (157/179 in total).


--- New in Py-notify 0.1.12  (25 August 2007) ------------------------

* New method AbstractVariable.transform().

* Some bugfixes and code improvements.

* 8 new unit tests (155/177 in total).


--- New in Py-notify 0.1.11  (22 July 2007) --------------------------

* Major speed optimization in signal emission.  Now all benchmarks run
  about 30% faster.

* Many small improvements and fixes in derive_type() machinery.

* Minor internal code improvements.

* 18 more unit tests (147/169 in total).


--- New in Py-notify 0.1.10  (1 July 2007) ---------------------------

* Possibility to freeze changes in conditions and variabes.

* For Python 2.5+ only: 8 context manager methods for signals,
  conditions and variables.

* Expanded tutorial.

* Other small improvements and fixes.

* 31 more unit tests (151 in total).  Now not all tests run under
  Python 2.3 or 2.4; for them there are only 129 tests.


--- New in Py-notify 0.1.9  (22 June 2007) ---------------------------

* Fixed and improved `setup.py' script.

* New RaisingGCProtector class.

* 6 new unit tests (120 in total).


--- New in Py-notify 0.1.8  (13 June 2007) ---------------------------

* Improved and fixed derive_type() class method in several
  AbstractValueObject-derived classes.

* Mediators and bindings got __hash__() method.

* Informative string representation added to bindings and
  DummyReference class, improved in signals.

* Other small improvements and fixes.

* 8 new unit tests (114 in total) and several improved.


--- New in Py-notify 0.1.7  (10 April 2007) --------------------------

* Improved documentation.  Some documentation files that didn't
  previously make it to source distribution now do.

* Many minor improvements and fixes.

* New `examples' subdirectory with one but non-trivial example.

* 1 removed and 9 new unit tests (106 in total).

* 1 new benchmark test (5 in total).


--- New in Py-notify 0.1.6  (4 April 2007) ---------------------------

* Adopted "Don't repeat yourself" principle, therefore most functions
  that duplicate properties are renamed and made private.  This breaks
  backward compatibility, but better now than never, since user base
  is nonexistent.

* Some bug-fixes and proper Pythonic __eq__, __ne__ and numeric
  methods.

* New DebugGCProtector class.

* Improved or added documentation for many methods.

* Infrastructure script improvements and fixes.

* 6 more unit tests (98 in total).


--- New in Py-notify 0.1.5  (3 March 2007) ---------------------------

* Added a tutorial.

* Improved or added documentation for many methods.

* New functions to cancel effects of synchronize() for condiions and
  variables.

* Several more properties in different classes.  In general, use
  properties instead of methods more.

* Some bug-fixes.

* 5 more unit tests (92 in total).


--- New in Py-notify 0.1.4  (16 February 2007) -----------------------

* New fast and generic GC-protector module (notify.gc) replaces
  inefficient mark_object_as_used() and mark_object_as_unused()
  functions.

* Speed optimizations in bindings.

* 2 more unit tests (87 in total).

* 2 more benchmark tests (4 in total).


--- New in Py-notify 0.1.3  (3 February 2007) ------------------------

* New class `WatcherVariable', just like `WatcherCondition'.

* Many bug-fixes in `Signal' class and in standard signal value
  accumulators.

* Speed optimizations in bindings and signals.

* 18 more unit tests (85 in total).



--- New in Py-notify 0.1.2  (28 January 2007) ------------------------

* Bug-fixes in `WatcherCondition' and `AbstractSignal' classes.

* Plugged memory leak in `AbstractValueObject' signal creation.

* 8 more unit tests (67 in total).

* Benchmarking support (with single comparison to PyGObject at
  present).



--- New in Py-notify 0.1.1  (23 January 2007) ------------------------

* First released version.

* Support for signals, conditions, variables, logical composition of
  conditions, predicate conditions and other features.

* 59 unit tests.
