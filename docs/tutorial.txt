Overview
********

Py-notify is an unorthodox implementation of `Observer programming
pattern`_.  Most important included concepts are *signals*,
*conditions* and *variables*.

At the core of the package are *signals*.  They are lists of
callables, termed *handlers*.  Signals can be emitted in which case
all connected handlers are called in turn.  The idea here is
separation of event *notifier* and *listeners*: when you emit a
signal, you needn’t know who listens to it, i.e. what handlers are
connected to it.

You may have encountered signals elsewhere, since they are quite a
widespread construct.  Among others, there are signals in `GTK+`_ (and
hence in PyGTK_), in Boost_, `sigc++`_ and so on.  They all have
certain similarity and provide more or less the same functionality.
Major distinction of Py-notify signals *are not typed*, following base
Python design principle.  You can pass any argument to a function and
so you can pass any arguments when emitting a signal.  However,
function can fail with that argument, and so can signal handlers.

On top of the signals two other main concepts of Py-notify are build:
*conditions* and *variables*.

Conditions are boolean values paired with one signal, which is emitted
when condition *state* changes.  They can be mutable (settable by you)
or not.  There is an all-purpose ``Condition`` class, instances of
which are mutable.  But if you need special functionality, like
retrieving state using certain function, you can easily derive a new
condition type.

Conditions of any type can be combined together using logic operators.
The result is yet again a condition, with its own ‘changed’ signal.
This way you can track states of compound logical expressions, like
“number of frobnicators is at least 3 *and* there is a doodle.”

Variables are much like conditions, but can hold arbitrary *value*
instead of a boolean *state*.  Variables cannot be combined using
logic operations, but have a different interesting feature:
``predicate()`` method.  It returns a condition, which state is always
the given predicate over variable’s value.  In other words, if
variable’s value changes. condition state is automatically recomputed
and might change as well.

Main idea of both conditions and variables is similar to that of
signals: separate provider of boolean state or arbitrary value from
parties interested in it.



Signals
*******

Without any further chit-chat, let’s create our first Py-notify
program.

::

    from notify.all import *

    def inform_of_frobnicator (frobnicator_type, num_tentacles):
        print ("A frobnicator of type '%s' with %d tentacles has arrived"
               % (frobnicator_type, num_tentacles))

    total_tentacles = 0

    def count_tentacles (frobnicator_type, num_tentacles):
        global total_tentacles
        total_tentacles += num_tentacles

        print 'Total tentacles so far: %s' % total_tentacles

    def run_if_scary (frobnicator_type, num_tentacles):
        if frobnicator_type == 'Slimy':
            print 'I panick'
            import sys
            sys.exit ()

    new_frobnicator = Signal ()
    new_frobnicator.connect (inform_of_frobnicator)
    new_frobnicator.connect (count_tentacles)
    new_frobnicator.connect (run_if_scary)

    new_frobnicator ('Friendly', 8)
    new_frobnicator ('Sleepy',   4)
    new_frobnicator ('Slimy',    12)
    new_frobnicator ('Hungry',   6)

Now, that is pretty much for a first program, but let’s be bold.
First line shows how you can avoid caring about specific modules in
Py-notify package.  Or you can import from different modules, you
decide.  Following are declarations of three functions.  They contain
nothing specific to Py-notify and you can just skip over.  The only
thing worth mentioning is the same signature.  We *expect* that those
two arguments will be passed on each signal invocation.

Now we come to interesting part.  First comes creation of the signal.
Since Py-notify signals are not typed, there is really not much to
pass to constructors (except for optional *accumulator* which is
described belw.)  Next we connect our three functions as handlers to
the signal.  Note that handlers only need to be callable, they all
just happen to be functions in our case.

Final four lines are the most interesting.  The four statements are
nothing else than *emissions* of the signal.  You can as well call
``emit()`` method, but just calling signal is absolutely the same.
So, it is only matter of taste which way to choose.  Note that in each
emission we pass two arguments.  These arguments mean nothing to
signal itself and are simply passed on to handlers.

Here is the output of the example::

    A frobnicator of type 'Friendly' with 8 tentacles has arrived
    Total tentacles so far: 8
    A frobnicator of type 'Sleepy' with 4 tentacles has arrived
    Total tentacles so far: 12
    A frobnicator of type 'Slimy' with 12 tentacles has arrived
    Total tentacles so far: 24
    I panick

First thing to note is that the handlers are called in order of
connection.  So that order can be important.  Next we note that
handlers are completely independent of each other.  We could as well
not connect some of them—it wouldn’t have any effect on the others.
At emission time we don’t need to know what handlers there are either.

So, part of the code that notes arrival of frobnicators doesn’t care
how such arrival is treated and who—if anyone—listens for it.  That’s
the whole point of signals or Observer programming pattern for that
matter.

There is certain notifier which provides a well-defined protocol for
its notification—in our case, the ``Signal`` object.  There can be
listeners for those notifications.  Notifier doesn’t even need to know
about listeners, as well as listeners don’t need to know anything
except the protocol.  In particular, notifier can reside in a library
and listeners in client code.



Handlers
~~~~~~~~

In our first example we connected a number of handlers to a signal.
Now let’s consider what is possible to do with handlers closer.

Sometimes, you want to connect a handler only for a limited time—not
for the whole lifetime of the signal—and disconnect it later.  Of
course that is possible to do with Py-notify.  The natural question
is, of course, what identifies a handler?  Most signal libraries I
know of assign a special identifier to a connection, for performance
reasons.  Py-notify takes a different approach here: you just pass the
handler again.

Comparison of handlers done by signals is less efficient than
comparison of handlers.  However, it is simpler to use (no need to
store identifier around) and is more in line with Python ideology.
Besides, handler disconnection should be quite rare to bother about
efficiency anyway.

Here is a simple example::

    from notify.all import *

    def note (object):
        print 'emitted with %s' % object

    signal = Signal ()

    signal.connect (note)
    signal (1)

    signal.disconnect (note)
    signal (2)

And the output is::

    emitted with 1

Signal is emitted twice, but ``note()`` handler is only called during
the first emission.  That is because it is disconnected right before
the second one.

Handlers can also be connected with arguments.  These arguments don’t
mean anything special to the signal itself, instead they will be
passed to the handler on each signal emission.  In case emission
itself has some arguments, the two sets are combined: first are
connection-time arguments, then emission argumens.

Here is a simple illustration::

    from notify.all import *

    def sum (a, b):
        print '%d + %d = %d' % (a, b, a + b)

    signal = Signal ()

    signal.connect (sum, 5)
    signal (10)

This simple program gives::

    5 + 10 = 15

Handlers with arguments can be disconnected as well.  You just need to
pass the same (or *equal* in Python sense) arguments to
``disconnect()`` method.  For instance, in the example above the only
handler can be disconnected with ``disconnect (sum, 5)`` code.

Also important is concept of *blocking* handlers.  Blocked handlers
remain in the list of connected handlers, but are skipped when
emission happens.  Of course, to make blocking useful, handler can be
unblocked.  A handler can be blocked several times, but then it needs
to be unblocked exactly the same number of times to become active
again.

Blocking is less common than connecting/disconnecting handlers, but
can be used to e.g. prevent reentrance.  For this, the handler would
just block itself, emit signal once more, and then unblock.



.. TODO: More About Emissions



Accumulators
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Typical signal emission discards handler return values completely.
This is most often what you need: just inform the world about
something.  However, sometimes you need a way to get feedback.  For
instance, you may want to ask: “is this value acceptable, eh?”

This is what accumulators are for.  Accumulators are objects specified
to signals at construction time.  It can combine, alter or discard
handler return values, post-process them or even stop emission.  There
are some predefined accumulators as members of ``AbstractSignal``
class, but you can define your own, if needed.

Let’s consider our example with the question outlined above.  We will
consider value acceptable if *all* connected handlers like it.  If it
not deemed unacceptable by at least one handler, we will consider it
unacceptable overall.  Here is the code::

    from notify.all import *

    def only_even (number):
        return number % 2 == 0

    def only_positive (number):
        return number > 0

    def not_some (number):
        return number not in (-2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 15)

    is_fine = Signal (AbstractSignal.ALL_ACCEPT)
    is_fine.connect (only_even)
    is_fine.connect (only_positive)
    is_fine.connect (not_some)

    print '%d is fine: %s' % (-10, is_fine (-10))
    print '%d is fine: %s' % (  4, is_fine (  4))
    print '%d is fine: %s' % (  7, is_fine (  7))
    print '%d is fine: %s' % (  8, is_fine (  8))
    print '%d is fine: %s' % ( 20, is_fine ( 20))

Here is the result::

    -10 is fine: False
    4 is fine: True
    7 is fine: False
    8 is fine: False
    20 is fine: True

−10 is liked by the first handler, but is rejected by the second one.
7 is dumped at the start, while 8 makes it to the last handler.
Numbers 4 and 20 are considered acceptable by all handlers and so they
are deemed fine overall.

This example is of course trivial to overwrite without signals.  But
consider that handler set has changed.  Removing line
``is_fine.connect (only_positive)`` changes the result::

    -10 is fine: True
    4 is fine: True
    7 is fine: False
    8 is fine: False
    20 is fine: True

Now −10 becomes fine too, since the other two handlers accept it.  As
before, main idea of signals plays its role: emitter doesn’t need to
know about way of handling.  Here, without changing emission part in
any way, we have changed the result the program gives.

Other predefined accumulators are:

``ANY_ACCEPTS``
    Makes emission statement return true value if any of the handlers
    returns true.  In a sense, this is a reverse of ``ALL_ACCEPT``.

``LAST_VALUE``
    Emission statement returns the last handler’s return value.  Not
    useful in most cases, but can be handy in a few specific ones.

``VALUE_LIST``
    Emission statement returns a list of all handlers’ return values.
    This could make a sane default, but was dropped for performance
    reasons.

.. TODO: Describe custom accumulator creation somewhere later.



Conditions and Variables
************************

Conditions and variables are pretty similar, so let’s have a look at
both of them at once.  (In fact they even share common
``AbstractValueObject`` base.)  Both concepts are really specific
signal instances that are emitted *only* when the associated value (or
boolean state) changes.

Here is a simple example featuring variables::

    from notify.all import *

    def welcome (user):
        print 'Hello there, %s' % user

    name = Variable ()
    name.changed.connect (welcome)

    import sys

    while True:
        sys.stdout.write ('What is your name? ')
        line = sys.stdin.readline ()

        if not line:
            break

        name.value = line.strip ()

This simple program will read user names from stdin and welcome them.
If you play with, you can notice that entering the same name twice in
a row will not cause the welcoming message being printed twice.  So,
despite two assignments to ``name.value``, the ‘changed’ signal is
emitted the first time only in this case, since the second value is
equal to the first.



‘Storing’ State or Value
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A common idiom is to ‘store’ condition state or variable value using a
handler.  Statement ``x.store (handler)`` is completely identical to

::

    handler (x.get ())
    x.changed (handler)

It is sometimes needed to call the handler with some initial state or
value.  ``changed()`` provides a standard way to call a function with
current state/value and arange to have it called again when
state/value changes.

As with normal handler connection, you can pass additional arguments
to ``store()`` which will be passed to the handler.



Compound Conditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What makes conditions really powerful is the simple way to combine
them in logical expressions.  Such expressions are conditions again
and thus have the ‘changed’ signal, can be combined in turn and so on.
Conditions also provide uniform support for combination, meaning that
all condition types, including derived ones, support combination out
of the box.

::

    from notify.all import *

    have_foo = Condition (False)
    have_bar = Condition (False)
    compound = have_foo & ~have_bar

    def print_states ():
        print ('have foo and not have bar: %s (%s and not %s)'
               % (compound.state, have_foo.state, have_bar.state))

    def on_compound_state_changed (new_state):
        print 'compound condition state changed to %s' % new_state

    compound.changed.connect (on_compound_state_changed)

    have_foo.state = False
    have_bar.state = False
    print_states ()

    have_foo.state = True
    have_bar.state = False
    print_states ()

    have_foo.state = False
    have_bar.state = True
    print_states ()

    have_foo.state = True
    have_bar.state = True
    print_states ()

To make a compound conditions you should just use bit operators
(``~``, ``&``, ``|`` and ``^``) instead of logic operators, ``not``,
``and``, ``or`` and ``xor`` correspondingly (last is missing from
Python.)

This gives the following result::

    have foo and not have bar: False (False and not False)
    compound condition state changed to True
    have foo and not have bar: True (True and not False)
    compound condition state changed to False
    have foo and not have bar: False (False and not True)
    have foo and not have bar: False (True and not True)

Note that the ‘changed’ signal on compound condition is emitted only
twice, despite the many changes in states of its *term* conditions.
As for any other condition (or variable), it is only emitted when the
state has indeed changed, not just when it might have changed.



Predicates Over Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Variables cannot be combined (see the previous sections), but support
building *predicate conditions*.  Such a condition is true or false
based on variable’s value and automatically recomputes its state when
that value changes.

The method is called ``predicate()``, as one would expect::

    from notify.all import *

    def print_state (is_over_5):
        print ('have at least 5 frobnicators: %s (%d)'
               % (is_over_5, num_frobnicators.value))

    num_frobnicators = Variable (0)
    num_frobnicators.predicate (lambda n: n > 5).store (print_state)

    for n in range (0, 10):
        num_frobnicators.value = n

As one would expect, this gives the following output::

    have at least 5 frobnicators: False (0)
    have at least 5 frobnicators: True (6)

Following the common conduct of conditions and variables, predicate
conditions only emit their ‘changed’ signal when their state changes,
not each time state is recomputed.



Garbage-Collection magic
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Example in the previous section may look somewhat strange to you: the
predicate condition is created and one handler is connected to it, but
it is not referenced from anywhere.  Yet the example works.  In fact,
conditions and variables do certain tricks ‘behind the scenes’ to
ensure they are not garbage-collected while they are used.  For
predicate conditions this means the variable is alive (in our case it
is referenced) and at least one handler is connected (in our case it
is ``print_state()``.)

In general, you can be sure that conditions and variables will not be
deleted as long as they are used in some common sense.  And they
*will* be deleted when they become unused [#]_, so there is no memory
leak here.

.. [#] Deletion may happen in a garbage collector run, so it will not
       necessarily happen instantly.
