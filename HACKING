			 TESTING YOUR CHANGES

Normally, Python will prefer installed Py-notify copy, so be careful.
Your changes might seemingly have no effect simply because they are
not executed at all.

You can make Python import Py-notify from your working copy by putting
this in start-up Python file of your code:

	import sys
	sys.path.insert (0, PATH-TO-YOUR-WORKING-COPY)

Py-notify tests (in the `test' directory) do this automatically, so no
special steps are required to make them test what they need to.

Also, if you run Python interpreter from the working copy directory,
it should import that Py-notify copy, not the installed one.



		   NEW-STYLE OR OLD-STYLE CLASSES?

Always use new-style classes.  Old-style will be even dropped from
Python 3.0.



				SLOTS

Don't forget to specify __slots__ = () in case class should not
introduce new slots.  Otherwise, instances will be created with a
dictionary and that is absolutely wrong for our case.



		      CALLING SUPERCLASS METHODS

Please always use super (..., self) idiom to call superclass methods
and don't specify explicit name.  This is somewhat slower, but not
error-prone if you change inheritance tree.  The only exception might
be multiple inheritance, but we currently don't use that at all.



			 OBJECT CONSTRUCTORS

Classes directly derived from `object' (and from anything else too)
and overriding __init__() function, must always explicitly call
superÂ (..., self).__init__().  This may seem like an unneeded
requirement, but otherwise multiple inheritance may cease to work.
Consider this:

	class C (object):
	    def __init__(self):
		print "C"
		# super (C, self).__init__()

	class D (object):
	    def __init__(self):
		print "D"
		super (D, self).__init__()

	class E (C, D):
	    def __init__(self):
		print "E"
		super (E, self).__init__()

	E ()

This example never prints "D", because class `C' never calls
__init__() method of its superclass.  If you uncomment the call,
initialization is back to normal.

So, while we currently don't use multiple inheritance at all, let's do
what is right and not track obscure bugs later.  Besides, who knows if
a user of the library uses multiple inheritance for some reason?
